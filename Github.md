# What is GitHub?

Imagine you and your friends are building a giant, awesome Lego castle together. 
Each of you is working on different parts of the castle, 
and you want to make sure everyone can see each other’s work, share ideas, 
and make changes without messing things up.

GitHub is like a magical Lego table for coding projects. It helps people work together on computer programs, just like you and your friends working on your Lego castle.

* What Does GitHub Do?
    - Share Your Work: Just like you can show your Lego castle to your friends, GitHub lets you share your code with others. This way, everyone can see and use your cool ideas.

   - Work Together: If your friends want to help with your Lego castle, they can add their own pieces. GitHub lets people work on the same code at the same time, so everyone can contribute to a project.

   - Track Changes: If you or your friends make changes to your Lego castle, you can keep track of what’s been added or changed. GitHub does this with code, so you can see who made what changes and why.

   - Backup Your Work: If something happens to your Lego castle, you might have a picture of it saved. GitHub saves copies of your code so you won’t lose your work.

* How GitHub Works
    - Repositories: Think of a repository as a big box where you keep all the pieces of your Lego castle or coding project. You can name this box and organize it however you like.

    - Commits: Every time you make a change or add something new, you can make a “commit.” It’s like taking a snapshot of your Lego castle so you can remember what it looked like at that moment.

    - Branches: If you want to try building a new part of your Lego castle without changing the main one, you can use a branch. It’s like creating a separate area to experiment with new ideas.

    - Pull Requests: When you’re ready to add your new Lego piece to the main castle, you can make a pull request. It’s a way of saying, “Hey, I’m done with my part. Can we put it all together?”

* Why Use GitHub?
GitHub helps people work together on coding projects from anywhere in the world. 
It makes it easy to share ideas, keep track of changes, and make sure everyone’s work fits together perfectly.
