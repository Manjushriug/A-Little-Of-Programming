### Assignment 3
Write a Program to calculate the sum of the first 10 natural numbers.

Here is steps for the same:

```
START

// Initialize a variable to hold the total sum
SET total = 0

// Loop through the numbers from 1 to 10
FOR number FROM 1 TO 10 DO
    // Add the current number to the total
    SET total = total + number
END FOR

// Print the total sum
PRINT "The sum of the first 10 natural numbers is:" total

END

```

Explanation:
* START: Marks the beginning of the program.
* SET total = 0: Initializes a variable total to store the sum.
* FOR loop: Iterates through each number from 1 to 10.
* SET total = total + number: Updates the total by adding the current number.
* PRINT: Displays the result.
* END: Marks the end of the program.
