The print function in Python is like a magic tool that lets you show text or numbers on the screen. 
In Python, there are a few different ways to use print to make your messages look just the way you want.

#### Basic Printing
 What it does: Displays whatever you put inside the parentheses.

Example:
`
print("Hello, world!")  # This will show: Hello, world!
`
#### Printing Multiple Items
What it does: You can print more than one thing at once by separating them with commas.

`
print("My age is", 10)  # This will show: My age is 10
`
#### Printing with a Custom Separator
What it does: By default, print separates items with a space. But you can change this by using the sep parameter

`
print("Apples", "Bananas", "Cherries", sep=", ")  # This will show: Apples, Bananas, Cherries

`
