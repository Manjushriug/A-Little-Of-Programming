Math operators in Python are like special symbols that help you do different kinds of math. Letâ€™s look at some of the most common ones:

1. **Addition (`+`)**:
   - This symbol is used to add two numbers together.
   - **Example**: If you have 5 apples and you get 3 more, you can find out how many apples you have in total by adding them.
   - **Code**: 
     ```python
     apples = 5 + 3
     print(apples)  # This will show 8
     ```

2. **Subtraction (`-`)**:
   - This symbol is used to take one number away from another.
   - **Example**: If you have 10 candies and you give 4 away, you can find out how many candies you have left by subtracting.
   - **Code**: 
     ```python
     candies = 10 - 4
     print(candies)  # This will show 6
     ```

3. **Multiplication (`*`)**:
   - This symbol is used to multiply two numbers.
   - **Example**: If you have 3 bags, and each bag has 4 toys, you can find out the total number of toys by multiplying.
   - **Code**: 
     ```python
     toys = 3 * 4
     print(toys)  # This will show 12
     ```

4. **Division (`/`)**:
   - This symbol is used to divide one number by another.
   - **Example**: If you have 12 cookies and you want to share them equally with 3 friends, you divide the cookies by 3.
   - **Code**: 
     ```python
     cookies_per_friend = 12 / 3
     print(cookies_per_friend)  # This will show 4.0
     ```

5. **Modulus (`%`)**:
   - This symbol shows the remainder after dividing one number by another.
   - **Example**: If you divide 10 candies among 3 friends, you will have some leftover candies.
   - **Code**: 
     ```python
     leftover_candies = 10 % 3
     print(leftover_candies)  # This will show 1
     ```

6. **Exponentiation (`**`)**:
   - This symbol is used to raise a number to the power of another number.
   - **Example**: If you want to know what 2 raised to the power of 3 is (which means 2 multiplied by itself 3 times), you use this operator.
   - **Code**: 
     ```python
     power = 2 ** 3
     print(power)  # This will show 8
     ```

So, in Python, you use these symbols to do different math operations. Just like using a calculator, these operators help you solve math problems and do calculations!
