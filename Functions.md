# Python Functions
Python functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task. They help organize code, make it more readable, and allow for reusability. 

## Basic Structure of a Function
A function in Python is defined using the def keyword, followed by the function name and parentheses. Hereâ€™s the general structure:
```
def function_name(parameters):
    # code block
    return value  # optional
```
## Functions with return values
In Python, functions can return values using the return statement. This allows you to get results from functions and use them in other parts of your code.
Example:
```
import math

def calculate_circle_area(radius):
    area = math.pi * (radius ** 2)
    return area

# Example usage
radius = 5
area = calculate_circle_area(radius)
print(f"The area of the circle with radius {radius} is {area:.2f}.")

```
Summary: Functions in Python are powerful tools for organizing code and promoting reusability
