## What are Conditionals?
Conditionals are like decision-makers in our code. They allow the program to choose what to do based on certain conditions. Think of it like asking a question: “If it’s sunny, I will go outside; otherwise, I’ll stay inside.”

The if, elif, and else Statements
* if: Checks a condition. If it's true, it runs the code inside.
* elif: Stands for "else if." It checks another condition if the first one is false.
* else: If none of the previous conditions are true, it runs this code.
