## Assignment: Math Operators in Python
## Objective: Learn to use basic math operators in Python to perform calculations.

Instructions:

Create a new Python file or use an interactive Python environment.

Choose two numbers: Create two variables, num1 and num2, and assign them any values you like. 
For example:
```
num1 = 10
num2 = 5

```

## Perform calculations using math operators and print the results:

* Addition (+): Calculate the sum of num1 and num2.
* Subtraction (-): Calculate the difference when num2 is subtracted from num1.
* Multiplication (*): Calculate the product of num1 and num2.
* Division (/): Calculate the quotient when num1 is divided by num2.
* Modulus (%): Calculate the remainder when num1 is divided by num2.

* Run your program to see the results of each calculation.

Extra Credit: Create a small interactive program where the user can input their own numbers for num1 and num2, 
and then see the results of the calculations. 
Use the input() function to get numbers from the user.
