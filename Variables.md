# Variables
Let's imagine you have a box. You can put different things inside the box, like toys, candy, or books. 
In Python, a variable is like that box. 
It’s a special place where you can store information that you might want to use later.

Here’s how it works:

1. **Naming the Box**: First, you give your box a name, like “favorite_toy” or “age”. This name helps you remember what’s inside the box.

2. **Putting Things Inside**: After naming your box, you can put something inside it. For example, you might put the name of your favorite toy or your age into the box.

3. **Using the Box**: Later, if you want to use the thing inside the box, you can just ask for it by using the box’s name. Python will look inside the box and give you what’s there.

Here’s a simple example:

```python
# Naming the box and putting something inside
favorite_color = "blue"

# Later, you can use the box to find out what's inside
print(favorite_color)
```

In this example:
- `favorite_color` is the name of the box.
- `"blue"` is the thing we put inside the box.
- `print(favorite_color)` is how we ask Python to tell us what’s inside the box.

So, variables are like boxes where you can keep and organize information. You can give them names, put things inside, and use them whenever you need!
