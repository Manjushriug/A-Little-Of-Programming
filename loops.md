## What is a Loop?
A loop is like a magical door that lets us do the same thing over and over again without having to write it multiple times. Imagine you want to say "Hello!" five times. Instead of writing it five times, we can use a loop!

Two Main Types of Loops
* For Loop: This loop is great when you know how many times you want to repeat something.

* While Loop: This loop keeps going as long as a certain condition is true.

## Using a For Loop
Hereâ€™s how a for loop works:

```
for i in range(5):
    print("Hello!")
```
This code prints Hello! 5 times

## Using a While Loop

```
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print("Hello!")
    count += 1  # This adds 1 to count each time
```

This code prints Hello! until the count reaches 5.

## Why Use Loops?
Loops save time and help us avoid mistakes. 
Instead of writing the same code again and again, we can just use a loop to handle it for us!

Remember!
* Loops help us repeat tasks easily.
* Use a for loop when you know how many times you want to repeat something.
* Use a while loop when you want to keep going until a condition is met.
