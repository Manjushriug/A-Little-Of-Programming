### Project 1
Create an interactive chatbot program that helps users learn and test their knowledge of world capitals.

Scenario:
Imagine you're designing an educational tool to make geography fun and interactive. The chatbot should:

* Ask users to name the capital of a randomly chosen country.
* Provide hints or feedback if the user struggles or answers incorrectly.
* Use Turtle Graphics to display information, such as:
      * A map with the country highlighted.
      * The country name and its capital.
      * Fun animations or congratulatory messages when the user answers correctly.
