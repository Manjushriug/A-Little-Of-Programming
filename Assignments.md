## Assignment: Age Checker
### Objective: Write a program that checks a person's age and determines whether they are a child, a teenager, or an adult.

### Instructions:
* Create a variable called age and set it to your age (or any age you choose).
* Use an if statement to check if the age is less than 13. If it is, print "You are a child!"
* Use an elif statement to check if the age is less than 20 (but 13 or older). If it is, print "You are a teenager!"
* If neither condition is true, use an else statement to print "You are an adult!"
* Test your program by changing the value of age to see how the output changes.
